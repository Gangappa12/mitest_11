GitHub Importer is a tool that quickly imports source code repositories, including commits and revision history, to GitHub.com for you.
During an import, depending on the version control system you're importing from, you can authenticate with your remote repository, update commit author attribution, and either import repositories with large files or, if you don't want to use Git Large File Storage, remove large files.
